Graduated with honours from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT) in 2019. 
Received a master degree in Applied Physics and Math from MIPT in 2021. 

Main research interests are focused on the magnetic material design and search for novel concept, 
material and device for fast and efficient computing. 

Current research is devoted to the ultrafast magnon dynamics and its application for wave-based logic.

Author and core developer of the [RAD-tools](rad-tools.org) package for the magnonics simulations 
and spin Hamiltonian treatment.
